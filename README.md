# Robert Collier React Portfolio

# Description

This is a single page application that shows my major projects. It has an about me section, a portfolio section,
a place to contact me, and a place to download my resume.

# Potential improvements

This page is responsive but could be made more responsive. This is easier if a framework like bootstrap is used. Additionally, the resume could download directly to the users hard drive instead of opening up in the chrome browser.
